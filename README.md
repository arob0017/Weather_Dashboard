# Weather_Dashboard

This is a Weather Dashboard for Travelers that want to travel Australia!

When a traveler types a city into the search bar and clicks the search icon, today's weather is displayed along with the following five days in blue cards underneath. The previously searched cities then become a button that will be displayed under the search bar. This way the traveler can remember which cities they have searched and if they need to look at that city's weather again they simply just need to click a button instead of typying it in again.

I have done this by using Html, Css, Jquery and Open Weather's API (https://openweathermap.org/api).
